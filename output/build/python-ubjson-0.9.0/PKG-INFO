Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is a Python v3.2+ (and 2.7+) `Universal Binary
        JSON <http://ubjson.org>`__ encoder/decoder based on the
        `draft-12 <UBJSON-Specification.md>`__ specification.
        
        Installing / packaging
        ======================
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            # To get from PyPI
            pip3 install py-ubjson
        
            # To only build extension modules inline (e.g. in repository)
            python3 setup.py build_ext -i
        
            # To build & install globally
            python3 setup.py install
        
            # To skip building of extensions when installing (or building)
            PYUBJSON_NO_EXTENSION=1 python3 setup.py install
        
        **Notes**
        
        -  The extension module is not required but provide a significant speed
           boost.
        -  The above can also be run with v2.7+
        -  PyPI releases are signed with the `Iotic Labs Software release
           signing key <https://iotic-labs.com/iotic-labs.com.asc>`__
        -  At run time, one can check whether compiled version is in use via the
           *ubjson.EXTENSION\_ENABLED* boolean
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        It's meant to behave very much like Python's built-in `JSON
        module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html>`__, e.g.:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import ubjson
        
            encoded = ubjson.dumpb({u'a': 1})
        
            decoded = ubjson.loadb(encoded)
        
        **Note**: Only unicode strings in Python 2 will be encoded as strings,
        plain *str* will be encoded as a byte array.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import ubsjon
            help(ubjson.dump)
            help(ubjson.load)
        
        Command-line utility
        ====================
        
        This converts between JSON and UBJSON formats:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            python3 -mubjson
            USAGE: ubjson (fromjson|tojson) (INFILE|-) [OUTFILE]
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        Static
        ------
        
        This library has been checked using
        `flake8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`__ and
        `pylint <http://www.pylint.org>`__, using a modified configuration - see
        *pylint.rc* and *flake8.cfg*.
        
        Unit
        ----
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            ./coverage_test.sh
        
        **Note**: This requires
        `coverage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage>`__.
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        -  The **No-Op** type is not supported. (This should arguably be a
           protocol-level rather than serialisation-level option.)
        -  Strongly-typed containers are only supported by the decoder (apart
           from for **bytes**/**bytearray**).
        -  Encoder/decoder extensions are not supported at this time.
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        The only existing implementation I was aware of at the time of writing
        (`simpleubjson <https://github.com/brainwater/simpleubjson>`__) had the
        following limitations:
        
        -  Does not support efficient binary encoding
        -  Only supports draft-9
        -  Only supports individual Python types rather than anything
           implementing an interface (e.g. *Mapping*)
        -  Does not decode nested arrays or objects in expected form
        -  Lacks C extension speed-up
