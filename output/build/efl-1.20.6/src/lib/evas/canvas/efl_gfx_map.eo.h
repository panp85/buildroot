 * @brief Texture UV mapping for all objects (rotation, perspective, 3d, ...).

 * Evas allows different transformations to be applied to all kinds of objects.
 * These are applied by means of UV mapping.
 *
 * With UV mapping, one maps points in the source object to a 3D space
 * positioning at target. This allows rotation, perspective, scale and lots of
 * other effects, depending on the map that is used.
 *
 * Each map point may carry a multiplier color. If properly calculated, these

 * At the moment of writing, maps can only have 4 points (no more, no less).

/**
 * @brief Apply a perspective transform to the map
 *
 * This applies a given perspective (3D) to the map coordinates. X, Y and Z
 * values are used. The px and py points specify the "infinite distance" point
 * in the 3D conversion (where all lines converge to like when artists draw 3D
 * by hand). The @c z0 value specifies the z value at which there is a 1:1
 * mapping between spatial coordinates and screen coordinates. Any points on
 * this z value will not have their X and Y values modified in the transform.
 * Those further away (Z value higher) will shrink into the distance, and those
 * less than this value will expand and become bigger. The @c foc value
 * determines the "focal length" of the camera. This is in reality the distance
 * between the camera lens plane itself (at or closer than this rendering
 * results are undefined) and the "z0" z value. This allows for some "depth"
 * control and @c foc must be greater than 0.
 *
 * The coordinates of the center point are given in absolute canvas
 * coordinates. See also @ref efl_gfx_map_perspective_3d for a pivot-based
 * perspective effect.
 *
 * @param[in] px The perspective distance X relative coordinate.
 * @param[in] py The perspective distance Y relative coordinate.
 * @param[in] z0 The "0" Z plane value.
 * @param[in] foc The focal distance, must be greater than 0.
